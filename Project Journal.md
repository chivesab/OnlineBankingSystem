* Splitting the project into two groups
	* Backend (Dustin and Yuche)
	* Frontend (Omar and Steven)
* By the next meeting, hopefully decide technologies for both and begin coding
* Decide on sprint length to be 2 weeks.

03/22/21
* Backend:
	* Using Springboot to build API and using MySQL as our persistent storage
	* Dustin is writing and finished some skeleton code so that he and Will can begin simultaneous work on the API
	* Looked into how to host Java programs in AWS EC2 and have a startup guide as to how that might work
* Frontend:
	* Exploring technologies to use for the front-end
	* What might be the most programmer friendly for people who have not done this kind of thing before
	* Flask looks like a reasonable candidate, but still exploring options.
	* Even if deciding technology takes a little while longer, it is OK
	* In the meantime can decide what pages need to be built
	* Diagram user flow and from that, design the wireframes for the web app

04/05/21
* Frontend:
	* Have finished constructing wireframes for core user flows
	* Plan on starting to build the website templates and pages
	* For framework, decided on Vue.js. It's open source and should fit our use case
* Backend:
	* Continue working on building the API.
	* MySQL database schema is sketched out
	* Plan to deploy test database and JAR to AWS


04/12/21
* Frontend:
	* Researching some more on which framework to use.
* Backend:
	* Continue working on building the API.


04/19/21
* Frontend:
	* Definitely decided on React.js
	* Login Page created with some functionality
	* Customer/Admin Dashboard skeleton with some functionality
* Backend:
	* Working on getting MySQL up and running on AWS and linked up to the (local)API


04/26/21
* Frontend:
	* Working on the popup forms for the Customer/Admin Dashboard
	* Improving the overall look and feel of the application
* Backend:
